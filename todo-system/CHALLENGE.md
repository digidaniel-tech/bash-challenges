# Challenge: Build a Simple Task Manager with Bash

**Description:** Create a Bash script that functions as a simple task manager. It should be able to add, display, mark as completed, and delete tasks. Tasks should be stored in a text file, and the script should have a user-friendly menu to navigate between different functions.

## Features to Include:

1. **Add Task:**
   - The user should be able to add a new task with a descriptive name and a deadline date.

2. **View Tasks:**
   - Display all tasks, including their status (completed or not) and deadline.

3. **Mark Task as Completed:**
   - Mark a task as completed, which should update its status in the list.

4. **Delete Task:**
   - Remove a task from the list.

5. **Save and Read Tasks:**
   - Tasks should be saved in a text file (e.g., `tasks.txt`). The script should read from and write to this file.

6. **Log Activities:**
   - All changes (add, mark as completed, delete) should be logged to a log file (e.g., `task_log.txt`) with a timestamp.

### Example Task Format in the Text File:
- **Task1 | 2024-09-01 | Pending**
- **Task2 | 2024-09-10 | Completed**

### Example Main Menu:
```
1) Add Task
2) View Tasks
3) Mark Task as Completed
4) Delete Task
5) Exit
```


Good luck with your task manager! This project will challenge you to combine file handling, user interaction, and logging, giving you a practical skill in Bash scripting.
